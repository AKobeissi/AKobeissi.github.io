Excited to share that my team and I won **2nd place** in the 2025 **FIAM Asset Management Hackathon**!  
We built a **systematic long–short equity strategy** powered by **reinforcement learning and deep learning** to rebalance a portfolio over time.  
We also added an **LLM agent** that reads company filings and macroeconomic reports to help adjust the portfolio each month, similar to how a human analyst would.
