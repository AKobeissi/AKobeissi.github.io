Hi, I'm Amine Kobeissi, a master's student in computer science at Université de Montréal, where I focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. My work lives at the intersection of research and practice—I enjoy experimenting with new model architectures, sharing what I learn, and helping teams translate ideas into working prototypes.

Before graduate school, I studied mathematics at McGill University with a concentration in business analytics. Much of my GitHub README highlights this mix of rigorous theory and practical problem-solving, along with ongoing projects that explore data-driven applications and AI-enabled tools. This site will grow alongside those projects—check back soon for deeper dives, notes, and resources.
